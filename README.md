# Vaccination-Management-System
This system was our Advanced_Programming project. We use C# and WindowsForm and SQl Server as database.
For using this system, it's better and easier that you install Visual_Studio and then install C# and WindowsForm packages there.
After that, you can run "CoronaVaccinationSystem.sln" on Visual_Studio and enjoy it :)
